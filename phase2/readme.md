In **Phase 2**, we’ll build on the foundation from Phase 1 by adding full interface support and enabling end-to-end data flow between the UE and DN. This phase will focus on implementing the remaining interfaces and refining network functions for more realistic traffic handling and QoS support.

### **Phase 2: Implement Core Interfaces and Protocols for End-to-End Data Flow**

#### **Objective:**
Enable comprehensive data flow and signaling between all network components, covering both user plane and control plane interfaces. This includes refining network functions (AMF, SMF, UPF) and adding support for inter-network function communication through the Service-Based Interface (SBI).

#### **Step-by-Step Implementation:**

#### 1. **Enhance Core Network Functions with Additional Interfaces**

   - **Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF)**:
     - **N8 (AMF - UDM)**: Use RESTful HTTP/2 to access subscriber data and validate registration/authentication requests.
     - **N11 (AMF - SMF)**: Enable session setup and management by linking the AMF with the SMF.
     - **N15 (AMF - PCF)**: Coordinate with the PCF to enforce policies related to mobility and access control.

   - **Session Management Function (SMF)**:
     - **N7 (SMF - PCF)**: Integrate with the PCF to apply QoS and charging policies on user sessions.
     - **N10 (SMF - UDM)**: Access subscriber profiles from the UDM to configure session parameters.
     - **N4 (SMF - UPF)**: Refine PFCP implementation for advanced session management, including handling multiple QoS levels and session prioritization.

   - **User Plane Function (UPF)**:
     - **N6 (UPF - Data Network)**: Improve IP forwarding and NAT for end-to-end connectivity with the external data network.
     - **N9 (UPF - UPF)**: If applicable, implement a multi-UPF architecture with N9 for hierarchical routing or edge deployment.

#### 2. **Implement RAN Enhancements**

   - **Radio Access Network (RAN)**:
     - **CU/DU Split Architecture**: Further develop the Central Unit (CU) and Distributed Unit (DU) split to handle PDCP, RLC, MAC, and PHY layers.
     - **N2 (RAN - AMF)**: Finalize NGAP over SCTP for seamless signaling, including support for handovers and multi-cell management.
     - **N3 (RAN - UPF)**: Enhance GTP-U for user data forwarding, supporting dynamic bearer management for different QoS levels.

#### 3. **Service-Based Interface (SBI) Communication**

   - **Control Plane Functions**:
     - Set up SBI communication with RESTful HTTP/2 for key interactions:
       - **AMF - SMF**: Manage session setup and mobility control.
       - **SMF - PCF**: Enforce policies on traffic flows and sessions.
       - **AMF - AUSF/UDM**: Authenticate UEs and retrieve user profiles.
     - Enable RESTful APIs for each network function to interact with other functions dynamically and scale across multiple instances.

#### 4. **Implement and Enforce QoS and Policy Control**

   - **Policy Control Function (PCF)**:
     - Integrate the PCF to apply policies (e.g., QoS, access restrictions) and manage service prioritization.
     - Enforce policy rules on the SMF for each session, ensuring that traffic requirements (e.g., low latency, high bandwidth) are met.

   - **Quality of Service (QoS) Profiles**:
     - Define QoS profiles for different types of traffic (e.g., voice, video, IoT).
     - Use SMF to configure the UPF with these profiles, allowing prioritized and reliable data delivery based on session needs.

#### 5. **Testing and Validation**

   - **Traffic Simulation and QoS Testing**:
     - Generate multiple traffic types (e.g., video, voice, and data) using a tool like Iperf.
     - Measure end-to-end performance metrics (latency, jitter, packet loss) to verify QoS enforcement.
   
   - **Inter-Function Communication Tests**:
     - Validate SBI messages between network functions, ensuring that AMF, SMF, PCF, and UDM communicate effectively.
     - Test session management, policy enforcement, and resource allocation.

#### **Outcome of Phase 2:**
After Phase 2, you’ll have a fully functional 5G core with complete interface support and the ability to manage multiple sessions with different QoS requirements. This setup will allow end-to-end data flow across the network and dynamic policy enforcement, creating a robust environment for simulating real-world 5G applications.
