In **Phase 4**, we’ll focus on finalizing the network setup by integrating **RAN enhancements, traffic simulation, and performance testing**. This phase will solidify the entire 5G standalone network environment, allowing for realistic traffic scenarios, comprehensive performance analysis, and optimization. Additionally, we’ll add multi-cell support and conduct end-to-end testing across all interfaces and functions.

### **Phase 4: Finalize RAN, Simulate Real-World Traffic, and Perform Testing**

#### **Objective:**
Complete the 5G standalone network by integrating an enhanced RAN with multi-cell capabilities, simulating various real-world traffic scenarios, and thoroughly testing the network's performance, stability, and compliance with 5G standards.

#### **Step-by-Step Implementation:**

#### 1. **RAN Enhancements and Multi-Cell Support**

   - **Multi-Cell Support in gNB**:
     - Extend the gNB implementation to support multiple cells (gNB-CU and gNB-DU) for a realistic cellular environment.
     - Implement inter-cell communication for managing UEs across cells, enabling load balancing, and minimizing interference.

   - **Enhanced Handover Mechanisms**:
     - Refine handover support to ensure smooth transitions between cells without packet loss or service interruption.
     - Add **handover control** between gNBs and AMFs, including support for different handover scenarios (intra-gNB, inter-gNB).
     - Enable the AMF to dynamically monitor and update cell assignment for each UE based on mobility and network conditions.

   - **Advanced Scheduler in RAN**:
     - Integrate an intelligent scheduling algorithm to manage multiple UEs, prioritizing resources based on QoS requirements.
     - Ensure efficient allocation of radio resources, particularly under high load conditions.

#### 2. **Traffic Simulation for Realistic Scenarios**

   - **Simulate Diverse Traffic Types**:
     - Use tools like **Iperf**, **Ping**, and custom traffic generators to simulate various applications:
       - **URLLC** (Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication): Simulate real-time control applications with stringent latency requirements.
       - **eMBB** (Enhanced Mobile Broadband): Simulate high-throughput applications like video streaming.
       - **mMTC** (Massive Machine-Type Communication): Generate IoT data with periodic, low-bandwidth transmission.

   - **Configurable Traffic Profiles**:
     - Configure traffic profiles for each simulated application, specifying QoS requirements (e.g., latency, jitter, packet loss).
     - Adjust profiles dynamically to test the network’s ability to adapt to fluctuating traffic conditions.

#### 3. **End-to-End Testing and Performance Analysis**

   - **Comprehensive Testing**:
     - Test end-to-end connectivity and validate all interfaces and protocols (N1–N16) are functioning as expected.
     - Conduct session continuity tests, ensuring the network can maintain sessions through handovers and varying load conditions.

   - **Performance Metrics Collection**:
     - Monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) across different traffic types, including:
       - **Latency**: Measure end-to-end delay for URLLC and eMBB applications.
       - **Throughput**: Record data transfer rates for broadband traffic.
       - **Packet Loss and Jitter**: Ensure reliability and consistency, especially for real-time and IoT applications.

   - **Failure and Recovery Scenarios**:
     - Simulate scenarios like network congestion, cell outages, and UE handovers to assess the network’s resilience and recovery time.
     - Validate the ability of network functions (e.g., AMF, SMF) to reroute and manage traffic during failures.

#### 4. **Optimization and Tuning**

   - **Dynamic Resource Allocation**:
     - Optimize resource allocation algorithms to balance loads across cells and prioritize critical sessions.
     - Fine-tune QoS parameters and resource allocation policies in PCF, SMF, and UPF for optimal performance under various traffic loads.

   - **Adaptive Policy Adjustments**:
     - Test and refine policies in the PCF to dynamically adapt to changing traffic patterns and conditions.
     - Implement adaptive QoS adjustments, allowing the network to adjust priorities and resource allocations in real time.

   - **Load Balancing and Scalability**:
     - Test load balancing across multiple UPFs and AMFs to ensure the network can scale as more UEs and traffic are added.
     - Introduce additional gNB instances and validate the network’s ability to handle increased RAN load and perform seamless mobility management.

#### 5. **Final Validation and Documentation**

   - **Compliance Testing**:
     - Ensure compliance with 3GPP standards by validating that each protocol and interface meets specified requirements.
     - Verify that SBI communications (HTTP/2) function as intended across all network functions.

   - **Documentation of Configuration and Results**:
     - Document configuration settings, traffic profiles, and test cases used during testing.
     - Compile performance data and document observations, especially around network stability, QoS enforcement, and resource allocation efficiency.

#### **Outcome of Phase 4:**
Upon completion of Phase 4, the 5G standalone network will be fully functional with multi-cell RAN support, dynamic policy control, and advanced QoS management. This network will be ready for testing in realistic scenarios, making it a valuable tool for evaluating 5G applications, policies, and optimizations.
