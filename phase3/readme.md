In **Phase 3**, weâ€™ll focus on implementing advanced features to support **policy control, session management, and Quality of Service (QoS)** requirements across different types of traffic. This phase will introduce more complex interactions within the 5G core network, enabling comprehensive policy enforcement, QoS management, and multi-session handling.

### **Phase 3: Add Policy Control, Session Management, and QoS Handling**

#### **Objective:**
Enhance the 5G network by enabling dynamic session management, policy control, and QoS support across different types of traffic, such as voice, video, and IoT. This phase ensures that traffic flows meet specified quality and priority requirements, creating a more realistic and robust 5G network.

#### **Step-by-Step Implementation:**

#### 1. **Advanced Policy Control with the PCF**

   - **Policy Definition and Enforcement**:
     - Create and implement a set of policies for managing session priorities, traffic shaping, and bandwidth allocation. These policies should address:
       - **Traffic types**: Prioritize real-time data (e.g., voice, video) over non-real-time data.
       - **Quality classes**: Define policies for different QoS classes, such as conversational, streaming, and background traffic.
     - Implement **PCF rules** to control QoS and access restrictions for each session, with enforcement at the SMF and UPF levels.

   - **Policy Rules in the SMF**:
     - Enable the SMF to interpret PCF policies and apply them to individual sessions.
     - Configure session parameters, such as **Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR)** and **Maximum Bit Rate (MBR)**, based on the policies defined in the PCF.

#### 2. **Dynamic QoS Management**

   - **Session QoS Profiles**:
     - Define **QoS profiles** for each traffic type (e.g., VoIP, video streaming, IoT).
     - Implement SMF and UPF handling to dynamically adjust QoS based on policy or traffic demands.
   
   - **Traffic Shaping and Priority Handling**:
     - Enable the UPF to perform **traffic shaping** and apply **prioritization rules** based on QoS profiles.
     - Configure the UPF to adjust traffic flows in real-time, ensuring compliance with policy rules for latency-sensitive applications.

#### 3. **Enhanced Session Management**

   - **Multi-Session Support**:
     - Allow the SMF to manage multiple sessions per UE, assigning unique QoS parameters for each session.
     - Implement session lifecycle management, including **session creation, modification, suspension, and termination**.

   - **Session Modification**:
     - Enable session modification procedures, allowing the SMF to dynamically adjust QoS parameters in response to policy updates, traffic demands, or handovers.
     - For example, reduce bandwidth for non-critical applications when higher-priority traffic requires more resources.

#### 4. **Mobility and Handover Management**

   - **Handover Support in AMF and SMF**:
     - Implement basic handover procedures to maintain sessions as UEs move across cells.
     - Coordinate between the AMF and SMF to ensure seamless transitions and maintain QoS requirements during handovers.

   - **Mobility Policy Handling**:
     - Define policies for handovers, ensuring that critical applications retain priority during cell transitions.
     - Enable the AMF to communicate with the PCF for mobility-related policy enforcement.

#### 5. **Traffic Generation and QoS Validation**

   - **Testing with Different Traffic Scenarios**:
     - Simulate various traffic types (e.g., real-time video, file downloads, IoT sensor data) using traffic generation tools.
     - Validate that the 5G core enforces QoS and prioritization policies correctly.

   - **Performance Monitoring and Logging**:
     - Monitor key metrics (latency, packet loss, throughput) for each traffic type to ensure QoS compliance.
     - Collect logs to analyze the effectiveness of policy enforcement and QoS adjustments across different sessions.

#### **Outcome of Phase 3:**
After completing Phase 3, the 5G standalone network will support advanced policy control, dynamic QoS adjustments, and session management, making it capable of handling diverse traffic types with distinct quality requirements. This setup will allow the network to dynamically adapt to changes in traffic demand, prioritize critical applications, and provide a high-quality user experience.

With these enhancements, the network will be prepared for realistic testing and experimentation, especially for applications requiring strict QoS like URLLC and eMBB. Let me know if you need more detail on any specific functionality for Phase 3!
