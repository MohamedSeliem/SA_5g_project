For **Phase 1**, we’ll focus on setting up the foundational 5G network components: **AMF**, **SMF**, and **UPF**. This phase will establish the initial connectivity between **User Equipment (UE)** and the **Data Network (DN)**, allowing basic signaling and data flow. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:

---

### **Phase 1: Setup of Basic Network Functions**

#### **Objective:**
Establish basic connectivity in a 5G standalone network by implementing and configuring key control and user plane functions (AMF, SMF, UPF) and verifying UE connection to an external data network (DN).

#### **Step-by-Step Implementation:**

#### 1. **Initialize the Core Network Functions**
   - **Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF)**:
     - **Purpose**: Handle UE registration, authentication, and mobility management.
     - **Implementation**:
       - Define the AMF to manage signaling over the **N1 (NAS)** and **N2 (NGAP)** interfaces.
       - Implement basic NAS message handling for registration and authentication requests.

   - **Session Management Function (SMF)**:
     - **Purpose**: Manage data sessions and control data traffic flow through the UPF.
     - **Implementation**:
       - Enable PFCP for communication with the UPF over the **N4** interface.
       - Implement session creation, modification, and termination methods to allow simple data sessions.
       - Configure rules for routing traffic from the UE to the DN.

   - **User Plane Function (UPF)**:
     - **Purpose**: Forward user data packets to the data network and ensure efficient packet routing.
     - **Implementation**:
       - Implement basic data forwarding using **GTP-U** on the **N3** interface to receive data from the RAN.
       - Configure a connection on the **N6** interface for routing packets to the data network.

#### 2. **Implement Interfaces for Connectivity**

   - **N1 (UE - AMF)**:
     - Protocol: NAS over IP.
     - **Implementation**: Implement registration and authentication signaling between the UE and AMF.

   - **N2 (RAN - AMF)**:
     - Protocol: NGAP over SCTP.
     - **Implementation**: Handle control plane signaling to establish connections and manage mobility between the RAN and AMF.

   - **N3 (RAN - UPF)**:
     - Protocol: GTP-U.
     - **Implementation**: Forward user data packets from the RAN to the UPF.

   - **N4 (SMF - UPF)**:
     - Protocol: PFCP.
     - **Implementation**: Set up session rules and traffic steering from the SMF to the UPF for basic data sessions.

#### 3. **Establish Basic Data Flow Between UE and DN**

   - **Data Network (DN)**:
     - Simulate a basic data network, representing an external network like the internet.
     - Configure the DN to accept and respond to packets routed through the UPF.

   - **Traffic Routing Configuration**:
     - Use the SMF to define simple routing rules, enabling UE traffic to reach the DN via the UPF.
     - Set up NAT or IP forwarding on the UPF to handle packet translation between the UE and DN.

#### 4. **Testing and Validation**

   - **Traffic Generation**:
     - Simulate a simple data session using a traffic generation tool (e.g., Iperf or Ping) from the UE to the DN.
     - Verify that the UE can send and receive data packets through the core network functions.

   - **Verification Metrics**:
     - Test for connectivity by checking packet delivery from UE to DN.
     - Validate that sessions are successfully established and that control plane signaling (registration and authentication) works as expected.

#### **Outcome of Phase 1:**
After completing Phase 1, you should have a minimal standalone 5G network setup where the UE can register with the core network, initiate a session, and successfully transmit data packets to and from the DN.
